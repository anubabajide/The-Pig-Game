A simple game with the following rules:
1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
2. In each turn, a player rolls a pair of dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
3. BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
4. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
5. The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
6. Winning score is 100 by default but can be set by players
7. If a player rolls double 6 twice in a row, his GLOBAL score gets wiped.

Enjoy ;)
